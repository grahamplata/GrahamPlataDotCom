            <p>At my core I am a filmmaker and amateur programmer. I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and am currently working as a private software developer alongside <a href="http://unicalabs.com//">UnicaLabs</a>. Prior to that I was with
                <a href="http://http://www.candoris.com//">Candoris</a>
                as a Client Warrior. In 2013 I graduated from Temple University with a focus in new media. This allotted me the privilege to join up with the talented filmmakers at
                <a href="http://www.standardproduction.com/">Gabello Studios</a>. and
                <a href="http://www.shuffleboxproductions.com/">Shufflebox Productions</a>. We created and produced content for clients ranging from eBay Enterprises, Rodale health and even Cadillac. My proudest moment so far was being given the opportunity to DP a joint venture with BMW and Men's Health.</p>
